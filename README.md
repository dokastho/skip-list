The purpose of this snapshot is to showcase my capability to research a computer science concept and implement it. Prior snapshots were done with the aid of content in completed courses, so I felt it was relevant to demonstrate my ability to produce a program based on independent research since that's a critical facet of computer science careers.

This program also demonstrates my understanding of pointers, linked lists, memory leak prevention, and randomized algorithms
